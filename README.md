# 🚀 QuickCopy — Built in Under 30 Minutes 🕒

> **“One-click copy. Zero drag. All yours.”**

QuickCopy is a **modern, secure, cloud-synced clipboard manager** built in **under 30 minutes** during a live coding session — from idea to GitHub Pages deployment.

No frameworks. No build steps. Just **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — powered by **Firebase** and designed for **real users**.

---

## 💡 The Vision
Most clipboard tools force you to:
- 🖱️ Drag text  
- 📏 Manually select content  
- 🔁 Use complex shortcuts  

**We flipped the script**:  
> Every snippet gets a big, beautiful **“Copy” button**.  
> One click. Done.  

And because your snippets are **yours alone**, we added:
- 🔐 Secure login (Email + Google)
- ☁️ Cloud sync across devices
- 🌓 Dark/light mode
- 🗑️ Full profile & account control

All in **one file per layer** — clean, fast, and competition-ready.

- **Firebase Firestore** — Real-time snippet sync
- **Vanilla JS (ES Modules)** — No bundler, no bloat
- **Modern CSS** — Responsive, dark-mode-aware, 2025 design
